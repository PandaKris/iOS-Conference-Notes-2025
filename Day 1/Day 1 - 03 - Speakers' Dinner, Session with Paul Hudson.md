Basically notes I wrote when we had a talk session with Paul Hudson (Hacking with Swift)

- How to keep in touch with the latest Swift updates?
	- Git compare updates from Apple from time to time, check the new functions and try it out yourself.

- The day 1 session was very engaging for both beginners and advanced coders, any tips on helping us create these kind of Activity?
	- Do a pair programming activity, pair those with similar knowledge together, this helps make them feel more comfortable by knowing there is someone on the same situation as them (compared to pairing with experienced ones, makes them feel like they dont belong). Along with mentor guidance.
	- Invite learners to explore what they want to do in the Academy, what kind of app they want to make, increase the engagement
	- Learning: brute force repetition
	- How the workshop was designed:
		- bullet points on what i want to teach, 
		- learning code is dull, but building things is interesting, practical ones
		- Teaching an API framework, build it and show the practicality

- How to design Activities that can cater to both beginners and professionals?
	- Meet in the middle
		- The pros can reach higher while the beginners can try to reach, 
		- Be practical to help zero experience grasp the detail
		- No need to go through every basic theory

- How to keep my energy level up doing Guiding Activities?
	- Love what you present

- SwiftUI vs UIKit? Which one should the learners be more exposed since the industry standard in Indonesia is UIKit?
	- What people need to be able to learn effectively is momentum. 
	- UIKit has a very steep learning curve, learning that from the start can get learners to feel bad about themselves (they dont belong, they cant make apps, etc). 
	- If they start with SwiftUI, hopefully the momentum will help them get through UIKit

- How to get over being afraid of making mistakes?
	- Be openly vulnerable, be honest with yourself. Open environment, you're gonna screw up and its ok
