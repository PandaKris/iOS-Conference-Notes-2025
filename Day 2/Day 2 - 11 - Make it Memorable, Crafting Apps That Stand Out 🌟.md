4 Phases

Idea
- Happens when you least expect it (take a break from work, toilet, sat down to read a book, walk to a museum)
- Take breaks, get inspired

Prototype
- Get to a result as quickly as possible, start that as quickly as possible while the idea is fresh
- Don't care about clean code, architecture, data model, but focuses on quick result, familiar technologies, copy paste
- Its ok to throw away that code afterwards
- because you know the requirements much better now
- discuss: is it fun and memorable? can i make it accessible?

Refine
- Nail the core experience, get rid of the interaction quirks
- Much more valuable to do in person rather than testflight when testing
- Only get initial impression only once
- Check AppleVis to get inspired about enhancing accessibility

Release
- Pre-orders: gave me deadlines that forces you to finish things up, and think about marketing material early
- Reuse as much as possible for your next idea

Value of reducing your scope
- Too many features, can't finish all of them
- Skip them, it gives ideas for an update
