**Prepare 3D Assets**
- Roadblocks:
	- High Skill Barrier, Time-Consuming Process
	- Expensive Tools and Software
	- Hardware Limitations
- A lot of things to know
	- Blender, Polgon, Maya, USDZ, AR Apps, Light Baking, Material X, Lighting, Physics, etc

Fundamental Blocks
- Geometry
	- Polygons, Vertices, and Meshes
- Textures
	- UV Mapping, Materials, and Lighting
- Formats
	- OBJ, FBX, USDZ

Pathways:
- Manual Modelling (Blender, Maya, 3Ds Max)
- Scanning Technology (photogrammetry, NeRF)
- AI-Generated 3D Models
	- NVIDIA Omniverse / Kaedim to auto-generate 3D models

Tools from Apple:
- RealityKit

Photogrammetry API from Apple
- Capture set of photos around the object to convert into 3D model

Object Capture API -> enhanced version, run on iOS

Free Assets: Polligon
Top tier stuff: Substance Painter, Materialize
File Format: "fbx/obj" for platform compatibility
"USDZ" for Apple AR
